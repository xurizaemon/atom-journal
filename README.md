# Journal

Nathan Sobo (@nathansobo) presented [this journal package](https://github.com/nathansobo/journal) at an OS//OS NZ workshop in 2015.

This is my fork, which I'm now maintaining for my own use. You're welcome to use but I'd expect the original repo to be a better bet. I'm not an Atom package expert by any measure.

Feel free to check the [issues](https://github.com/xurizaemon/journal/issues).

# TODO

* Emacs M-x journal to use same structure.
* Add a twitter bot that I can throw journal entries at, and have it append to journal.
